## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Plain CSS

### What I learned

This was a very simple project which did not teach me much in terms of HTML/CSS, but it did give me an opportunity to get familiar with the deployment procedure on Vercel, particularly how different environments work.

### Continued development

Since this project was very simple, it lacks responsiveness (apart from using the `max-width` property). Therefore, I am going to focus more on this area in the future projects.

### Useful resources

I did get an opportunity to refresh my knowledge on how the `box-shadow` CSS property works. To that end, I used [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) as a resource.
